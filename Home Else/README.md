# Web-site-design-project
Project Goal and Key Deliverables:

Our goal is to develop a website which serves as a platform where people can hire web designers by their design style and wage and where freelance web developers can post their information and get hired. Key deliverables include:
1. A home page which has the website description (including average wages of designers, average turnaround time, number of freelance designers who are open for work) and simple examples of the styles available.
2. Each designersâ€™ introduction page
3. A web form to collect work inquiries
4. Some preview features supported by java
